# Ensemble Methods: XGBoost & Random Forest 

XGBoost and Random Forest are machine learning algorithms used for prediction and classification tasks. They learn patterns from data by combining multiple decision trees.

* Random Forest improves accuracy by averaging many independent trees.
* XGBoost builds trees sequentially, focusing on correcting previous errors.

Both are widely used for feature importance analysis and robust predictive modeling.
